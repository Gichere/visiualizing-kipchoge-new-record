# Visiualizing kipchoge new marathon record
On saturday October 12, 2019, Eliud Kipchoge broke (unofficially) the two-hour marathon barrier.
I saw Neil Saundersâ€™ Twitter post on visualizing the new record and decided to try and reproduce it with runners instead of points. 
I obtained the data from a Wikipedia page with {rvest}R package, wrangled and tidied it and eventually plotted it using {ggimage} R package.
## I hope this can inspire someone on how R is a powerful yet interesting and versatile language in the field of data science
