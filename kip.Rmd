##########Visualizing Eliud Kichoge's new marathon record###
#Let’s start with loading the packages we’ll need
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(ggimage)
library(hrbrthemes)
#We’ll use {tidyverse} for tidy manipulation and 
#plotting, {janitor} for cleaning the column names, 
#{lubridate} for working with dates, {ggimage} for 
#a plot with images and {hrbrthemes} for a nice quick
#aesthetic theme.

#####Retrieving data from wikipedia#####

wiki_url<-"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_world_record_progression"
runners_wiki<-wiki_url %>% 
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@id="mw-content-text"]/div/table[1]') %>%
  html_table(fill = TRUE) %>%
  as.data.frame()

#Using the {rvest} package we are able to scrape the
#Wikipedia page for the table we wanted

######## Wrangling the Data #######
#Let’s look at our table to see what we have and what we’ll need to do:
head(runners_wiki, n=3)

#A little messy but that’s OK. What we’ll need to 
#visualize Eliud Kipchoge’s record is the Name, 
#Time and Date of all runners. We’ll start with 
#cleaning our data:
runners_clean<-runners_wiki %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  select(1,2,4)
#The clean_names function cleans the column names making them easier to use.
str(runners_clean)
#looking at the variables structure to see if we
#they need any manipulations. Yes, it seems both the
#time and date are not recognized appropriately 
#(In this case they’re characters) - let’s fix that:

runners_mutate<-runners_clean %>%
  add_row(time = "1:59:40", name = "Eliud Kipchoge",
          date = "November 12, 2019") %>%
  mutate(run_period_raw =hms(time),
         run_duration = as.numeric(run_period_raw,"minutes"),
         run_year = year(mdy(date))) %>%
  select(c(-date, -time))
#First I add Eliud Kipchoge’s new unofficial record 
#as an observation into our dataframe. Then turn
#to the {lubridate} package where I use the hms function
#to mutate the time variable we had into a new variable
#called ‘r_period_raw’. Although this cleans
#the variable, hms transforms it into a period object 
#What we need is to turn it into a numeric class which
#we did in our new variable ‘run_duration’. 
#This will help us in plotting but I retained the 
#period class variable as it makes it easier to read
#in this case.
runners_mutate[5,4]<-1909

ggplot(runners_mutate, 
       aes(x = run_year, y = run_duration)) +
  geom_point()
#Now we want to make it a little less crowded so we 
#can easily insert an image of runners instead of 
#points and not have it cluttered.
runners_mutate %>% pull(run_year)

year_sub<-c(1908,1920,1929,1947, 
            seq(1960,1980, 10), 1999,2011,2019)

runners_mutate <- runners_mutate %>%
  filter(run_year %in% year_sub)
